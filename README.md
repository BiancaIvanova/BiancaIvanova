# Hi, I'm Bianca! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a high school student from London who likes to make cool things!

## ðŸš€ About Me 

Iâ€™m passionate about computer science, especially when it comes to solving problems and exploring new technologies. Whether itâ€™s competitive programming, software development, or... well... robotics, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to challenge myself and improve.

One thing you'll quickly learn about me: wherever there are robots, youâ€™ll find me! Iâ€™m actively involved as a competitor, volunteer, or team mentor in most major educational robotics programs, including VIQRC, V5RC, FLL, and FTC.

I've spent the most time on these two teams:
- Entropy 17711E (VEX V5 Robotics Competition)
- Equuleus #21187 (FIRST Tech Challenge)

I've cumulatively won over 30 awards at regional, national, and international levels in competition robotics.
